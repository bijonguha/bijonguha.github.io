#### Video Analytics Team
- *Object detection* based on YOLO and RetinaFace. Used pretrained ResNET and Mobilenet backbone for RetinaFace. Used pretrained Darknet backbone for YOLO. Retrained YOLO on custom dataset for enhancing accuracy
- *Image Classification* Dataset aggregation, Transfer learning based on ResNET models deployed with PyTorch. Trained with One Cycle policy (super convergence), weight decay used
- Image Processing based counting : Hough Circles, Blob detection, Morphological separations based counting
- Detection based counting : Used Tensorflow API for object detection to detect object based on SSD+Mobilenet, SSD+Resnet, Faster RCNN + NasNET and prepared performance report
- Density based counting using UNET : Created point annotation tool, trained UNET from scratch on biological cell dataset
- Skillset: *Object Detection, YOLO, Retina Face, ResNETs, FastAI, Transfer Learning, Image Processing, Hough Circles, Morphology, Medical Data*

####  Handwritten Optical Character Recognition
-  Detection, recognition and analysis of handwritten mathematical equation and report generation using image processing and computer vision.Line detection, Character Segmentation, Character recognition using self-designed deep learning model with very high accuracy.
-  Python package development as a plug and play module. Extensively used Keras and Tensorflow for this project.
- Skillset: *OCR, DCNN, Weight Decay, Model Ensemble*

####  Predictive Analytics of digital systems
-  Development of supervised ML models for a global customer to predict and identify defective data points based on discrete historical data. Multiple use cases were solved using different sets of ML algorithms which involved Data Pre-Processing, Statistical Analysis and Model Development.
-  ML algorithms majorly used were Logistic Regression, Random forest Classification, XG Boost classification, Anomaly detection, SMOTE based data imbalance correction and classification.
- Skillset: *EDA, Statistics, VIF, SMOTE, Data Imbalance, Grid Search, Feature Importance*
