Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Indian Institute Of Technology, Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/) where I completed my [Integrated Masters in Applied Mathematics](https://iitr.ac.in/Academics/Applied%20Mathematics%20And%20Scientific%20Computing.html) (2013-2018). 

I'm currently working as a Senior Machine Learning Engineer for **FORD USA** in the SIEMENS Advanta AI team. My responsibilty is to lead a team of 3-5 members and collectively we are creating a plotform of Visual Inspection which will possibly scan all the parts real time of Ford Cars/SUVs sold in USA/Chine/Germany with very high accuracy. 

I'm also a [Researcher](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f0EqKYZwoP0r_8AEckvhMpQYJIz-omW0?usp=sharing) fostering the culture of creativity and innovation at wherever I work. I strongly beleiver that innovation is the unrelenting drive to break the status quo and develop anew where few have dared to go

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
